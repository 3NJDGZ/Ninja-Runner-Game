# Ninja-Runner-Game
This project is just a basic ninja runner game where the goal is to last as long as possible whilst avoiding the enemy flies. You can jump over the flies or shoot kunais. However, the collision between the flies and the kunai do not work, and I will not be bothered to be fixing it any time soon as this is an old project that I made in Year 10.
